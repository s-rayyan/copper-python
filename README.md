# Securly Python bypass
This is a tool that you can use to run python on school computers without using a .exe file which is blocked in some school districts.
- Download the download script
- Open downloads in your browser `Ctrl+J`
- If you get a this file could damage your device warning press `keep`
- Press `Open File`
- It will open a command prompt window and do things in there, this means it is working, dont close it
- After it automatically closes, open powershell and now you can use the python command

This is not CPython the normal version of python that you may be used to, this is a version of IronPython.
Though most features work, a lot of features are missing, in the actual IronPython there is no print function or an input function, I had to code them manually, the print function isn't perfect yet, I'll include more details.
